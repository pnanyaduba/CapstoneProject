<h2>
   Executive Summary
    <br>
</h2>


**Overview.** All over the world millions of credit card transactions are constantly processed by hundreds of financial institutions. 
These transactions often are processed in real time and often cross geographical regions and borders. More often than not, 
speed and timeliness is the key factors that holders of credit cards view as motivation for using online transactions. However, 
these qualities have their downsides. One key downside is the risk that customers will loose their funds if their credit card 
details are stolen.

Hundreds of fraudulent transactions from stolen credit cards occur on a daily basis. Most customers whose credit cards have 
entered the wrong hands most times, find out when they receive invoices or receipts of what they didn't pay for.

Often this constitute a risk for the issuing financial institutions who sometimes face serious penalties as a result of transactions from compromised credit card. This high risk factor can cost financial organizations dearly. 

Consequently, financial organizations have turned to technology and Artificial Intelligence to aid in detecting fraudulent credit card transactions and hence in order to lower their risk. In addition to lowering their risk, detecting and foiling fraudulent credit card transactions will improve the image, business and integrity of the institutions.

**The Problem.** How can financial institutions lower their risk by actively detecting in real time, fraudulent credit card transaction?

**The Methodology.** This project provides an avenue to help financial institutions detect in real time credit card fraud using machine learning algorithm. The methodology used involves 5 key machine learning techniques which include imbalanced class handling, categorical features, clustering and classification, sequential modelling and performance measures.

The dataset utilized contains a 2-day transactions made by European credit card users in September 2013. About 492 fraudulent transactions were identified from 284,807 transactions. The dataset has highly imbalanced classes. These dataset have been processed using Principal Component Analysis. The target feature is the 'Class' field which can either be a 'zero' or a 'one' representing legitimate or fraudulent transactions respectively. 

The dataset used has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.

In executing the project, the general information about the dataset is obtained. Existence of null values is checked. The distribution of the dataset is plotted to get a clear picture of the data. Next, the distribution of the classes are separated for analysis. The statistical characteristics of both legitimate and fraudulent transactions are obtained and compared. Below is the definition of the dataset:

- The dataset contains a total of 284,807 transactions
- There are two classes of data. Fraud class which contains 492 transactions and Legitimate class which contains of 284,315 transactions.
- The dataset is highly unbalanced and Fraud class represents 0.172% of all transactions.
- The dataset has been pre-prepared and has the numerical features resulting from PCA transformation.
- Features include Time, V1, V2, V3 to V28 and 'Amount'.
- Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning.
- Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.


The next step involves handling the Imbalanced classes in which under-sampling was utilized instead of over-sampling in order to minimize the computational cost. An equal amount of both legitimate and fraudulent transactions are then obtained. The under-sampled data is not split into Train and Test sets.

Models were developed and tuned using the under-sampled train dataset. The models used include LogisticRegression, KNNClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and the DecisionTreeClassifier. RandomForestClassifier model was finally selected based on its performance. The model's accuracy is obtained and the threshold is determined.


**The Findings.** The findings from the study are as follows:

1. RandomForestClassifer produced the best F1 Score and Threshold to predict fraud detection. 
2. The mean of fraudulent transactions is about $122.29.
3. The maximum amount of all fraudulent transactions is about $2,125.87
4. The accuracy of the RandomForestClassifier is 0.9538
6. The threshold that will maximize the model's ability to predict fraudulent transactions is 0.60
7. Most Fraudulent transactions are under $1,000
8. Most transactions greater that $1,000 can be considered as outliers


**Recommendation.** It is recommended that focus should be placed on transactions that are less that $1,000 as most fraudulent transactions occur at amounts less or within that range.

**Conclusion.** In conclusion, Using  a RandomForestClassifer provides an effective machine learning mechanism to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

<h2>
   Rationale
    <br>
</h2>

The project is targeted at Banks or financial institutions whose objective is to combat and foil fraudulent credit card transactions in real time.



<h2>
   Research Question
    <br>
</h2>

How can financial institutions and Banks effectively combat fraudulent credit card transactions?

#### **Sourcing**
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection. The dataset used can be attributed to Andrea Dal Pozzolo, Olivier Caelen, Reid A. Johnson and Gianluca Bontempi. Calibrating Probability with Undersampling for Unbalanced Classification. In Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining (CIDM), IEEE, 2015

<h2>
   Data Preparation
    <br>
</h2>

Below are steps followed for preparing the data for analysis:

- The dataset has been pre-prepared before it was obtained and contains numerical features resulting from PCA transformation.
- The dataset contains fields which have been pre-prepared and contains a 2-day credit cards transactions by european cardholders in Sept. 2013.
- The dataset contains a total of 284,807 transactions
- There are two classes of data. Fraud class which contains 492 transactions and Legitimate class which contains of 284,315 transactions.
- The dataset is highly unbalanced and Fraud class represents 0.172% of all transactions.
- Features include Time, V1, V2, V3 to V28 and 'Amount'.
- Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning.
- Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
- Lastly, the imbalanced dataset was processed using under-sampling in order to obtain a balanced dataset
